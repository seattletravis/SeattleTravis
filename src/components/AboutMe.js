						Bachelor of Science in Math and Chemistry June 2007

						<b>More About Me</b>
						<br></br>I was born in a small town in the Yakima Valley in WA
						State. It remains today, a dry irrigated desert oasis in the summer
						and a frozen otter pop in the winter. Out of town, there's farms
						until one reaches the basalt plains, then there's big sky.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						Early in life I liked math and started applying myself to be ready
						to go on to a University. I didn't know what I wanted to study so I
						picked chemistry, education, and math. It could have been any of the
						sciences (I like them all). In the Yakima Valley, K-12 educators are
						hireable, and the profession is a safe bet. So there, in Yakima, I
						recieved an associate of arts degree in early childhood education,
						with most of my electives being math and science. Afterwards, I
						moved to Central Washington University. Although I had a lot of
						credits in education, I decided to take a Bachelors of Science in
						Chemistry with a minor in Math.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						During my time at the CWU, a degree in chemisty required electives
						to be filled with engineering courses. Since the math classes were
						going to my minor, I took a lot of engineering courses as well. It
						was through the instructors in these courses that I was able to get
						to know my future employer, North Star Casteel. I took a job as an
						intern at North Star in 2007.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						North Star Casteel is a full Steel Casting facility specializing in
						Manganese Steel. It's a small company of around 70 emoloyees, each
						office manager works directly with the employees and the owners.
						After my internship I moved into several different roles at North
						Star as the Assistant Manager. Writting procedures comes naturally
						to me. I would leave a role better off as I moved on to another. I
						would improve the process as much as I could, make up written
						procedures for the more technical aspects of the process, then move
						on to another position (anywhere I was needed), all while being
						available for questions on my knowlegde base from previous
						positions. Some positions I filled for long periods of time, getting
						to know and improve the systems and the whole time working with
						employees and the owners to keep the foundry running as efficiently
						as possible. This job was nice but... I had always felt the desire
						to learn programming and work as a software developer.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						While I was working at North Star, we had a computer fail on the
						spectrometer used to check the %alloys on the metal while it was in
						the furnace. We used this data to run a program that would tell the
						melters how much alloy was needed to add to the metal to correct the
						chemistry for the customer requested alloy. I was tasked with
						rebuilding the system to get it back up and running as soon as
						possible. The previous additions worksheets had a MS excel interface
						and had been very hard to use by the melters who had limited
						computer skills. I parsed the data from the excel and pulled it into
						a Python tkinter GUI so the melters could easily run the additions
						calculator and get the information they needed to get the needed
						metal chemistry for the customer. Doing this project in Python at
						North Star game me a can do attitude in programming, and I began to
						think that I too could become a software engineer. Not too later
						after that project the Covid-19 Pandemic hit. With Seattle's public
						places shut down for the better part of 2 years. I had more than
						enough personal time to spend working in python. So for years I ran
						the foundry in the day time (other managers worked from home as much
						as they could) and in the evenings, I wrote code, studied tutorials,
						and practiced new technologies. I decided that coding was what I
						wanted to pursue, and at one point subscribed to Udemy.com and
						started studying several more technologies. For some reason learning
						comes easy for me. Over time I became proficient in Visual Studio
						Code. I've become more confident in Linux, and have become familiar
						with docker containers, GitHub, and Scripting as well. I even log
						into HackerRank to earn badges and get certificates. As Seattle
						opens back up following the pandemic, it seems different but the
						same. Everything is moving quickly and I want to find a place to fit
						into the tech community.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						Seattle is a great city in a terrific area. From the waterways of
						the Puget Sound to the mountain trails of the Cascades. The Pike
						Market Place to the Smith Tower Obeservation Deck. The City has a
						lot to offer. I've enjoyed it here, and consider myself from
						Seattle.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						I enjoy any technical hobbies. I build ukuleles, and I make a
						terrific home brewed IPA. Lately, I can be found developing games in
						python or javascript, working on my web site in React, or taking
						udemy classes in any language or data structure I find interesting.
						My goal at this very moment is to move out of the steel foundry
						position and get hired as a software developer.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>Footnote:</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						Welcome to LamberteDesign.com and thank you for taking the time to
						browse my web page. I'm currently trying to change my career from a
						modestly paid steel foundry manager to become a better paid software
						developer. I know this wont be easy and I'm prepared to work very
						hard as a Jr. developer while I gain experience. I'm looking for
						that first job. Email me if you have a job opening you think I would
						be good at filling.
